# Artist Booking System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the artist booking functionality that allows artists to create and manage their booking offers with pictures, experience details, availability, and booking fees.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `booking-setup-simple.sql` into the editor
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

This will create:
- `bookings` table - stores all booking information
- `booking_images` table - stores multiple images per booking
- `booking-images` storage bucket - for storing booking images
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

### Step 2: Verify Setup

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
node test-booking.cjs
```

This will test:
- Artist authentication
- Booking creation
- Booking retrieval
- Booking updates
- Booking deletion
